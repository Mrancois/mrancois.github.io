BarDuino is the annual project for my master. This is a project that requires the creation of a REST API, a mobile application and a connected object (IoT).
<br/>
This is a bar that distributes drinks automatically, the user orders what he wants to drink via the mobile application, then he must go to the bar so that the machine distributes it to him.

### Software - Raspberry PI:
How it works:
The air pumps are connected to the relays and the relays are connected to the GPIO ports of the raspberry. The python script directly controls the relays which themselves activate or deactivate the air pumps according to their state.
First the camera is on standby. When the camera detects a QRCode, it looks at first if this QRCode is present in the list of commands. Then starts the service of the drink if it is the case.

Handle QRCode with ZBARCODE (Python script):
- Read QRCode with the camera
- Check the QRCode
- Activate of air pumps
- ...


### Software - Mobile Application (iOS):

Develop with Swift
Libraries : Alamofire & SwiftyJSON Components :
- Login
- Historical orders
- Credit purchases
- ...

### Software - REST API:

Develop with Django-Rest-Framework (RESTful web services), it was host on Heroku
Routes available (POST / PUT / GET / DELETE) :
- /login
- /cocktails
- /drinks
- /commander/:idCocktail
- ...
